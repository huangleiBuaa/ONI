# Orthogonalization by Newton's Iteration (ONI) 

Code for reproducing the results of our accpeted CVPR 2020 paper (Oral):
**Controllable Orthogonalization in Training DNNs** ([arXiv:2004.00917](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.00917))

This repo provides the Pytorch and Torch implementations of our methods. 
* `ONI_PyTorch`: Pytorch project for ImageNet classification and GAN experiments.
* `ONI_Torch`: Torch project for Cifar-10 Classfication.
